# FingerPaintView
![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/API-21%2B-brightgreen.svg?style=flat) [![Android Arsenal]( https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Arsenal-FingerPaintView-green.svg?style=flat )]( https://android-arsenal.com/details/1/6715 )

A simple view to allow drawing on top of any bitmap, which generates a final bitmap with the correct scaling and transformations applied to it, ensuring the output respects what is shown on the screen.

## How to install

Add this in your root `build.gradle` file (**not** your module `build.gradle` file):

```gradle
allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
	}
}
```

Add this to your module's `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
dependencies {
	...
	implementation 'com.github.PicnicSupermarket:FingerPaintView:1.0'
}
```

## How to use

1. Include the `FingerPaintImageView` into your layout `xml` file. Make sure you set the base `src` image:

```xml
<tech.picnic.fingerpaintview.FingerPaintImageView
        android:id="@+id/finger"
        android:layout_width="300dp"
        android:layout_height="300dp"
        android:layout_alignParentTop="true"
        android:layout_centerHorizontal="true"
        android:layout_marginTop="8dp"
        android:src="@drawable/ic_launcher_background"
        app:inEditMode="true" />
```

2. Make sure the view is in edit mode (`app:inEditMode="true"`)

3. Go crazy drawing on the view. When you're done with the drawing, you can access the final bitmap
via the view's `getDrawable()` method. This bitmap will be the result of the original bitmap combined with your custom drawing.
```java
val bitmap = fingerPaintView.bitmap
```

## Features
* `WYSIWYG`: transformation and scaling is applied to ensure the final bitmap is the same as what you see on screen
* Define different settings for each individual path
* Smooth b√©zier paths
* Undo and clear all support

## Customization
The following attributes can be set either via xml or programmatically at runtime to generate different drawing effects:

```xml
<attr name="strokeColor" format="color" />          <!-- color of the path -->
<attr name="strokeWidth" format="dimension" />      <!-- width of the path -->
<attr name="inEditMode" format="boolean" />         <!-- enable/disable drawing on the view -->
<attr name="touchTolerance" format="float" />       <!-- smoothness between paths -->
```
